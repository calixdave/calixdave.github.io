                <h2>Vacation</h2>
                <p>
                    Vacations are important because they give my mind and body a real chance to reset from the constant pressure of my school and work activities, and also provide relief from the stress of daily activities, and responsibilities. Stepping away from routines reduces stress, improves sleep, and helps prevent burnout, which makes you more focused and productive when you return. Time off also creates space for relationships and new experiences—whether that’s exploring a new place, spending time with family, or simply resting—so you come back feeling more motivated and emotionally balanced. Even a short vacation can restore energy, improve mood, and remind you that life isn’t only about deadlines and tasks. I live in <abbr title="Massachusetts">MA</abbr> but I want to visit a beach in Saint Thomas this year.
               </p>
<h3>Places I would like to Visit</h3>

    <h2>Senior Design Project</h2>
    <p>
        For our senior Design project, we are designing a multi agent communication system that will aim for efficient communication in unreliable environment. Our testebed will use two different forms of communication to try to communicate in that set up; Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) and Radio frequency (RF). The system will use reenforcement learning to help agent collect data about their surrounding, send these data to the mission leader and later take decision based on their location, past experience and command received from the misson leader.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am responsible for the sensing subsystem of the project. I am building a vurtual grid which will also maps a physical grid that I created for the system with one by one foot tiles. I dotted each agent with the ability to scan their environment and turn it into a 3 by 3 grid with a bigger grid viewed as the whole field. The agents will later convert the data collected from their surrounding into a 3 by 3 matrix and send it to the mission leader. The misson will have control over the entire field from the data recieve and pass command when necessary to the agent to ensure a smooth communication among team member to facilitate the mission which to find a target of interest.

<section id="friendReconnect">
    <h2>Reconnect with friends and familly</h2>
    <p>
        Started college three (3) years ago. I have prioritize my academic career over everything, since I have realized that in order to acheive my dream I had to take that decision. Life is full of thing that could have make me lose focus and I did not want that to happen. Knowing that I will always have friends familly so I have focussed more on my academic journey since this is a one time opportunity that has to be taken. At the end of the spring semeste, I will make a list of all familly members and friends that I have to reached out before graduation day and reconnect if possible. If I lose a friend, I will definitly make new ones.
