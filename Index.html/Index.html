                <h2>Vacation</h2>
                <p>
                    Vacations are important because they give my mind and body a real chance to reset from the constant pressure of my school and work activities, and also provide relief from the stress of daily activities, and responsibilities. Stepping away from routines reduces stress, improves sleep, and helps prevent burnout, which makes you more focused and productive when you return. Time off also creates space for relationships and new experiences—whether that’s exploring a new place, spending time with family, or simply resting—so you come back feeling more motivated and emotionally balanced. Even a short vacation can restore energy, improve mood, and remind you that life isn’t only about deadlines and tasks. I live in <abbr title="Massachusetts">MA</abbr> but I want to visit a beach in Saint Thomas this year.

    <h2>Senior Design Project</h2>
    <p>
        For our senior Design project, we are designing a multi agent communication system that will aim for efficient communication in unreliable environment. Our testebed will use two different forms of communication to try to communicate in that set up; Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) and Radio frequency (RF). The system will use reenforcement learning to help agent collect data about their surrounding, send these data to the mission leader and later take decision based on their location, past experience and command received from the misson leader.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am responsible for the sensing subsystem of the project. I am building a vurtual grid which will also maps a physical grid that I created for the system with one by one foot tiles. I dotted each agent with the ability to scan their environment and turn it into a 3 by 3 grid with a bigger grid viewed as the whole field. The agents will later convert the data collected from their surrounding into a 3 by 3 matrix and send it to the mission leader. The misson will have control over the entire field from the data recieve and pass command when necessary to the agent to ensure a smooth communication among team member to facilitate the mission which to find a target of interest.

    <h2>Resume Review</h2>
    <p>
My resume is good to me, however it needs to be updated to relect new accomplishment as I am getting close to graduation. I also need to have some professors to review it since they are experience people and they more in the industry than I do
